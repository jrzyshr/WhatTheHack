[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge03.md)

## Introduction

Your team is wondering what options are available to leverage automation for the migration of SQL Server infrastructure to the cloud. In doing so they would be able to accelerate the migration at scale and take advantage of intelligence learnings from the field. 

## Description

The objective of this challenge is to migrate TPCC (benchmark database - http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/) to Azure. The TPCC database is used as a benchmark for a typical OLTP workloads. 

Your company has provided the following requirements and guidelines:

* Must take advantage of latest automation tools available to execute migration at scale.
* Migration efforts must be strategic by taking into considerations the recommendations provided through Machine Learning algorithms.
* Improve the quality of the process by ensuring it could be repeated.
* Source databases setup is using the industry benchmark tools.

## Success Criteria

* Successfully migrate the SQL Server VM hosting TPCC database meeting the above criteria.
* Share the Assessment report with the team for collaboration on knowledge sharing.
* Complete validation of the migrated TPCC database.
