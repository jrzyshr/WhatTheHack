* For the minikube cluster use the [following instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/master/azure_arc_k8s_jumpstart/docs/onboard_k8s.md) to onboard the cluster. 
* For GKE cluster use the [following documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/master/azure_arc_k8s_jumpstart/docs/gke_terraform.md) to onboard the cluster to Azure Arc. 
    * The GKE onboarding guide talks to both the deployment of the cluster and onboarding. The [onboarding section](https://github.com/microsoft/azure_arc/blob/master/azure_arc_k8s_jumpstart/docs/gke_terraform.md#connecting-to-azure-arc) is relevant to this challenge.
