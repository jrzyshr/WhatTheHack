# What The Hack - Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes Hack

## The Proctor's Guide and Lecture slide decks

The hack is based on 7 challenges that build atop one another increasing in complexity. This hack assumes a fairly robust prior knowledge of Kubernetes and Azure so set the expectations accordingly when planning the hack. 

Because of the involved nature of prerequisites it is recommended to conduct a **Know Before You Go** meeting where the contents of [challenge 0](../Student/challenge00.md) are discussed.

Below are the solutions and a guide on how to solve for the challenges within the hack.

## Challenges
 - [Challenge 0](./Solutions/challenge00.md) - Setup (Pre-day)
 - [Challenge 1](./Solutions/challenge01.md) - Deploy Kubernetes cluster on GCP
 - [Challenge 2](./Solutions/challenge02.md) - Deploy Kubernetes cluster locally
 - [Challenge 3](./Solutions/challenge03.md) - Onboard clusters onto Azure Arc
 - [Challenge 4](./Solutions/challenge04.md) - Enable Monitoring and Alerting
 - [Challenge 5](./Solutions/challenge05.md) - Enable GitOps
 - [Challenge 6](./Solutions/challenge06.md) - Enable Azure Policy
 - [Challenge 7](./Solutions/challenge07.md) - Manage remote cluster via Azure Policy
