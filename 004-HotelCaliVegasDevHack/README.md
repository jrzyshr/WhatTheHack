# What The Hack - Hotel CaliVegas Dev Hack

## Introduction
Build a cloud native application to allow guests to find, connect and share their Vegas hotel experiences using Azure PaaS and Serverless. Common application scenarios can be but not limited to building an online solution to support hotel customers in Vegas who wish to receive extra casino loyalty awards by sharing their posts and pictures at that hotel. 

As part of building cloud native applications, you will also want to leverage continuous integration/continuous delivery practices from the very beginning.  This means deploying your applications into your Azure subscriptions view Build and Release capabilities using Azure Pipelines. 

**NOTE:** You should read the entire set of challenges before starting.  The first 4 challenges should be completed before moving on to the remaining challenges. Some of the additional goals can be started and completed in nearly any order. Some can be performed simultaneously, and some goals can only be achieved with certain platform or tool choices.  Any pre-requisites are listed with the challenge.

## Guidance and Recommendations
- Leverage PaaS and Serverless as much as possible (look at the technology hints to get clues on potential technology)
- For this hackathon, while working on the challenges is a goal, the more important goal is to work together as a team.  Each team will have people who can easily complete the challenges.  It is important to share knowledge and progress as a team, making sure everyone gets through the challenges together.

## Prerequisites
This is a list of pre-requisites needed to successfully complete the challenges.  Some of these are items to deploy to your development machine.  Some are decisions you should discuss and define as a team, like the language to use for development.
- Determine the language for the app and services.  These can be the same or different depending on the skills of the team (ie: ASP.NET Core Web app and Node.js API Service).  
- Coding IDE – Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio Enterprise
- Git for Windows – allows for working with Git repositories locally on your machine as well as in Azure DevOps. 
    - <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
- Azure DevOps Project for your team.
	- Project Structure – the Azure DevOps project is pre-provisioned with all of the tasks required for each challenge, just not how they should be accomplished.  This is where your team will work.  
	- Under this project structure, you may organize your code repo as you see fit to complete the challenges and successfully work together.
- Determine Azure Subscription you will use for deployment
