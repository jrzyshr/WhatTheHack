to do list

- Folder structure guidance
	- Remove "Guides" and "Resources" from guidance
	- We should just have "Coaches" and "Students" folders and tell them that challenge md's 
	should go in here in addition to any code or resources needed
	- We need to tell them:
		- Students: All files in here will be delivered to the students.
		- Coaches: Any files that we want coaches to see above and beyond the student files
- aka.ms/wth repo root README.md
	- document the WTH format (including remote delivery with teams)
	- NOTE: This is the marketing spiel
	- link to tracking form / registration form/site

- template for hack root README.md for all hacks
	- Intro
	- Learning Objectives
	- Links to Challenges
		- One sentence intro and link to challenges in a list
	- Prerequistes (optional)
	- THIS IS A MUST. We need to make sure people can shop for their hacks in a consistent way.

- template for a challenge.md
	- look at all the ones and come up with best example
	- this template should be optional, not necessary to be retroactive, only going forward.
		- if we have time can go back to some of the hacks and do them (ie: 001)
	- CHALLENGE: how to handle delivery to students:
		- give them a direct repo link, but they will see answers
		- make a copy of files and dump in Teams (problem with MD links)
		- make a fork of repo for the event, and delete all answers
		- keep a redundant word doc, with only challenge text
		- use an MD to PDF generator to product student files and dump to teams

- 000-HowToHack
	- THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
		- the focus of WW Best Practice OCP
		- this is the deliverable that Gino and Peter did
	- contains templates for a hack (root readme and challenge MDs)
	- content development MD
		- all the instructions for contributing/writing new content
	- event delivery MD
		- all the instructions for running the event
		- how to do it in person
			- this a superset of virtual, will still need teams set up
		- how to do it virtually
			- write up how to registry link
			- how to create and setup teams
	- event kick off powerpoint template
		- more or less the same

- optional: create a seperate marketing website
	- CSAs make a request to have WTH
		- WTH team will then find facilitators
	- Include a calendar of WTH events
