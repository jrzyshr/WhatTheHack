# Challenge 1 (Setup)
1) There is a DownGit link in the [Student Setup](../Student/01-Setup.md) for students to download a zip of the contents of the resources folder.  They will need to unzip the file to access the folders and content.
1) If the DownGit link is not working, zip the folder and place in the Teams' files tab for the event.
